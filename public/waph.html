      <h3>Labs</h3>
      <dl id="labs">
        <dt>Lab 1</dt>
          <dd>
Lab 1 was a basic introduction to HTTP and web applications. We wrote minimal CGI programs in C and PHP, and then examined the HTTP requests our browsers made and our CGI programs' responses. I was already fairly familiar with HTTP, so I didn't learn too much from that part of it, but I'd never written PHP code before, so I still learned a little bit.
          </dd>
        <dt>Lab 2</dt>
          <dd>
This lab dealt with basic HTML and javascript, including ajax. I'd worked with HTML/CSS/javascript before, so I didn't learn much there, but I hadn't used jQuery at all before. This part of the lab was just given to us in the slides, but I also hadn't done something like drawing the analog clock before.

      <h3>Hackathons</h3>
      <dl id="hackathons">
        <dt>Hackathon 1</dt>
          <dd>
Hackathon 1 was about cross site scripting. The first task was made up of 7 different attack exercides where we had to get javascript injected into a webpage. For levels 2-6, we also had the guess what the code was on the server. The second task was to secure code we wrote in previous assignments to prevent the attacks we carried out in task 1.

I have very little PHP experience, so the biggest thing I got out of this lab was learning how to use `htmlentities` in PHP code.

      <h3>Individual Projects</h3>
      <dl id="individual-projects">
        <dt>Individual Project 1</dt>
          <dd>
Individual project one dealt with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript, but for a slightly larger assignment than Lab 2. We needed to set up a resume site using CSS and Javascript libraries/frameworks (like you usually do in real projects). This page was also part of individual project 1.
